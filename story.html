                <p class="text-2xl tracking-widest">Loki arrived in a swirling vortex of energy, his cape billowing behind him. He was armed with his signature scepter, which he used to mind-control several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, including Dr. Erik Selvig and Clint Barton.
                Loki then proclaimed himself Earth's new ruler and demanded that the Menschheit, or humanity, surrender to him. His bold arrival and declaration of war marked the beginning of a global crisis that would soon bring together the Avengers for the first time.

            <p class="text-2xl tracking-widest">Thor and Iron Man were escorting the villain Loki when he cunningly used his powers to distract them and escape their custody. Loki had previously obtained the incredibly powerful cosmic artifact known as the Tesseract, and he used it to instantly teleport himself away to an unknown location. This allowed Loki to elope with the Tesseract, slipping away right under the noses of Thor and Iron Man. Now free again, Loki was able to continue enacting his devious plans against the Avengers using the immense power of the Tesseract he had eloped with.</p>

            <h1 class="text-6xl mb-8">Battle of NYC</h1>
            <p class="text-2xl tracking-widest">The Avengers teamed up to defend New York City from an alien invasion led by Loki. Loki used the power of the Tesseract to open a spatial portal above Stark Tower, allowing the alien Chitauri to enter Earth's atmosphere and launch a full-scale attack. The Chitauri swarmed the city, destroying buildings and vehicles as they fired upon civilians and police. The Avengers sprang into action, with Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, and Hawkeye coordinating their efforts to push back the invasion. After intense fighting across the city, the Avengers were able to close the portal and defeat Loki and his alien army. This iconic battle marked the first time Earth's mightiest heroes banded together to defend humanity, establishing the Avengers as a formidable team.</p>
