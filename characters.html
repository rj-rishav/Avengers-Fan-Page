                    <h1 class="text-8xl">Captain America</h1>
                    <p class="font-extrabold">Steve Rogers was a frail young man who wanted to serve his country during World War II. He was chosen for a secret experiment called Project Rebirth that transformed him into a super soldier with enhanced strength, speed, agility, and reflexes. After the experiment, Rogers took on the mantle of Captain America and fought against the forces of HYDRA, led by the villainous Red Skull. Armed with his iconic vibranium shield, Captain America inspired hope in the Allied forces as he led them to victory. Though he sacrificed himself to save the world at the end of the war, Rogers was later found frozen in ice and revived in the modern day. He continued to fight for justice as an Avenger while trying to adapt to life in the 21st century. Despite being a man out of time, Captain America's unwavering courage and dedication to doing what's right made him a beloved hero and a symbol of American ideals.</p>

                    <p class="font-extrabold">Thor is the god of thunder in Norse mythology and a powerful superhero in the Marvel universe. As the son of Odin, Thor possesses incredible strength, durability, and control over lightning and stormy weather. He wields the mystical hammer Mjolnir which allows him to channel his godly abilities. After being banished from Asgard to Earth, Thor learned humility and helped protect humanity from threats like his adopted brother Loki. As a founding member of the Avengers, Thor contributes his mighty abilities in the team's fight against evil. His superhuman skills are matched by his bravery and desire to do the right thing. Yet underneath his serious exterior, Thor has a lighthearted side and brings camaraderie to the team. His experiences on Earth have taught Thor that with great power comes great responsibility. Though he hails from a distant realm, Thor's adventures and battles alongside earthlings have made him a loyal friend and noble guardian.</p>

                    <h1 class="text-8xl">Hulk</h1>
                    <p class="font-extrabold">The Hulk is the powerful alter ego of Dr. Bruce Banner, a brilliant scientist who was exposed to gamma radiation in a laboratory accident. When angered or provoked, Banner transforms into the rage-fueled green-skinned Hulk, who possesses immense superhuman strength, durability, and regenerative abilities. With his catchphrase "Hulk smash!", the Hulk is driven by pure emotion and is nearly unstoppable when enraged. Though the uncontrolled, rampaging Hulk sometimes becomes a threat when unleashed, the character also has a heroism within. This duality leads Banner to avoid transforming into the Hulk, as he fears the damage and havoc the Hulk could unleash. However, when fighting as an Avenger alongside heroes like Iron Man, Thor, and Black Widow, the Hulk has learned to channel his primal power towards good. Though the inner struggle between Banner's intellect and the Hulk's brute force continues, the Hulk remains one of the most powerful protectors of humanity. His strength and inner valor make him an invaluable member of the Avengers when civilization faces monumental threats.</p>

                    <p class="font-extrabold">Brilliant billionaire Tony Stark is the armored superhero known as Iron Man. After surviving a life-threatening kidnapping, Stark created a suit of armor that would help him fight crime and terrorism. Powered by a miniaturized Arc Reactor in his chest, the Iron Man suit grants Stark incredible strength, durability, and an array of weapons and technological innovations. Though initially hesitant to become a hero, Stark eventually used the suit to protect the world as Iron Man, becoming the poster boy of the superhero team the Avengers. However, Tony Stark struggles with alcoholism and questions about using his company for solely military purposes. He must balance his personal demons with the responsibilities of being Iron Man. Stark relies on his engineering ingenuity to upgrade and modify his armor, devising solutions to overcome any adversity. Despite his charismatic yet arrogant attitude, he is defined by his intelligence, Hollywood lifestyle, immense wealth, confidence, and daring heroism as Iron Man.</p>

                    <p class="font-extrabold">Clint Barton, aka Hawkeye, is a skilled agent and expert marksman who uses a specialized bow and set of trick arrows to take down enemies with precision. A master archer, Hawkeye displays near-perfect accuracy whether firing standard arrows or specialized arrows that employ explosives, EMPs, boomerangs, or other weapons. With no superhuman powers of his own, Hawkeye relies on his extraordinary abilities as a archer and athlete. Though he often employs humor and seems detached, Hawkeye is an invaluable member of the Avengers team, providing long-range combat support and reconnaissance from his raised perch. Hawkeye's keen eyesight pairs with his sharpened focus and timing to strike targets from great distances. A consummate professional in his craft, Hawkeye is capable of pegging targets others cannot even see. Off the battlefield, he maintains intense discipline and practice to stay at the peak of human skill as an archer. Hawkeye proves that skill combined with advanced equipment can make someone without superpowers into a formidable hero who can stand alongside super soldiers and gods</p>

                    <p class="font-extrabold">Natalia "Natasha" Romanova, alias Black Widow, is a highly trained spy and assassin turned superhero. Originally an agent of the Russian KGB, Black Widow later defected to join the ranks of S.H.I.E.L.D. and later the Avengers. Though she does not have any superpowers, Black Widow is in peak physical condition and is a master of martial arts, weaponry, and psychological manipulation. Equipped with high-tech tools like her "widow's bite" electroshock weapons and "widow's line" grappling hook, she relies on her dexterity and wits to outmatch foes. Black Widow is an expert in espionage techniques and remains coldly pragmatic even under fire. Beyond her skills in combat, she is a gifted tactician and field commander. Her past shrouded in mystery, Black Widow struggles to wipe the red from her ledger through her work with the Avengers. She maintains an icy exterior and avoids getting close to her teammates to keep her emotions from interfering with her missions. Black Widow's danger and mystique make her an invaluable member of the Avengers in the field and one not to be underestimated.</p>
